## Projects

[Three Point Strategy](https://github.com/sebasdarius/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/basketball_analysis/three_point_strategy.ipynb):
Explored how NBA teams change their strategy based on time left in the game and the score. Used a Genralized Additive Model (GAM) to model their strategy in the clutch.

[NFL Pass Rusher Deception Metric](https://github.com/sebasdarius/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/o_line_analysis/disguise_score.ipynb): Developed a metric to evaluate the effectiveness of an NFL defense in disguising their pass rush. The project involves clustering unblocked pass rushers using k-means, building a 2D CNN to predict pass rushers, and calculating the deception metric to assess the defense's performance.

[Basketball Hall of Fame Prediction](https://github.com/sebasdarius/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Basketball_HOF/Model_Selection.ipynb): Developped a random forest model that gives NBA players' probabilities of making the Basketball Hall of Fame based on career stats and accomplishments. This project involved scraping data and combining data from several datasets.

[NYC Arrest Data Exploration](https://nbviewer.org/github/sebasdarius/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/NYC_Arrests_EDA.ipynb): I took data released by the city of New York which documents every arrest made by the NYPD from 2006 to 2019. I use visualizations including maps and charts to better understand the nature of these arrests.
