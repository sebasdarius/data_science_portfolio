## Projects

[Basketball Hall of Fame Prediction](https://github.com/sebasdarius/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/Basketball_HOF/Model_Selection.ipynb): A model that gives NBA players' probabilities of making the Basketball Hall of Fame based on career stats and accomplishmments. This project involved scraping data and combining data from several datasets.

[NYC Arrest Data Exploration](https://github.com/sebasdarius/data_science_portfolio/blob/master/NYC_Arrests_EDA.ipynb): I took data released by the city of New York which documents every arrest made by the NYPD from 2006 to 2019. I use visualizations including maps and charts to better understand the nature of these arrests.
